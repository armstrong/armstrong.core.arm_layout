armstrong.core.arm_layout
=========================
Provides layout related code for use in Armstrong and Django projects.

``arm_layout`` provides you with tools to help streamline displaying content
from within your application.


Usage
-----
To load the template tags, add the following line (generally at the top of your
template):

::

    {% load layout_helpers %}

Once you have loaded the ``layout_helpers``, you can use the ``render_model``
template tag to display a given model like this:

::

    {% render_model some_model "full_page" %}

``some_model`` is a variable in your template that is a model instance and the
string ``"full_page"`` is the name of your "layout".  ``render_model`` looks
for a template named ``layout/<app_label>/<model>/<layout>.html`` to determine
what to use to display your model instance.

``render_model`` goes one step further, however.  It is smart enough to walk
through the inheritance of the model to determine if there are any other models
that have the layout that can be used.  For example, if ``some_model`` was
an instance of ``armstrong.apps.articles.models.Article`` which inherits from
``armstrong.apps.content.models.Content``, ``render_model`` looks for the
following templates, in this order:

::

    ["layout/articles/article/full_page.html",
     "layout/content/content/full_page.html", ]

You have access to the entire template context inside the ``full_page.html``
template.  You also have a new variable called ``object`` which represents the
model instance that you provided to ``render_model``.  That variable is only
available inside the layout template and temporarily overrides any context
variable called ``object``.  Once ``render_model`` is finished, it restores the
original context.


Installation & Configuration
----------------------------
You can install the latest release of ``armstrong.core.arm_layout`` using `pip`_:

::

    pip install armstrong.core.arm_layout

Make sure to add ``armstrong.core.arm_layout`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.  You
can add this however you like.  This works as a copy-and-paste solution:

::

	INSTALLED_APPS += ["armstrong.core.arm_layout", ]

.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/
