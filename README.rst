armstrong.core.arm_layout
=========================
Layout code related to Armstrong


Installation
------------

::

    name="armstrong.core.arm_layout"
    pip install -e git://github.com/armstrong/$name#egg=$name


Usage
-----
First, make sure that ``armstrong.core.arm_layout`` is installed then add it to
the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list of your Django settings.  Next, inside any
templates you want to use this in, add the following line (generally at the
top of the file)::

    {% load layout_helpers %}

Now, you can use the ``{% render_model %}`` template tag to render any model
like this::

    {% render_model some_model "full_page" %}

Let's assume ``some_model`` is a model called ``Article`` that extends the
model ``Content``.  These models are in ``armstrong.apps.articles`` and
``armstrong.apps.content``, respectively.  This would attempt to load the
following templates in your configured template directories::

    ["layout/articles/article/full_page.html",
     "layout/content/content/full_page.html", ]

These template names follow the pattern of
``layout/<app_label>/<model_name>/<name>.html``.  ``armstrong.core.arm_layout``
is currently concerned with HTML, so the ``html`` extension is the default.  It
may be configurable in future releases.

The two parameters you provide ``render_model`` are a variable that represents
a model and the name of the layout you want to use for that model.  The name
can be either a string (surrounded by single or double quotation marks) or a
variable to that can be resolved to a string.

Inside the various ``full_page.html`` templates, you have access to the entire
context of the calling template, plus a new variable called ``object`` that
represents the model you passed in.

.. note:: The ``object`` variable inside ``full_page.html`` is only available
          inside the template.  Once ``render_model`` has finished, ``object``
          is removed from the context.  Any variable called ``object`` in the
          calling template is left untouched.
